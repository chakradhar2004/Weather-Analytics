/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for WeatherWise Dashboard.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their favorite cities.
 * Weather data is publicly readable but only writable by a trusted source (not yet implemented in these prototype rules).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, including favorite cities.
 * - /weather_cache/{cityId}: Stores cached weather data for each city.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Weather data is publicly readable.
 * - Write access to weather data should eventually be restricted to a trusted server.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - User data, including favorites, is stored in a single document keyed by `userId` to enforce ownership without extra lookups.
 *  - The `cityId` serves as document ID for `weather_cache` to optimize lookups.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Public weather data is stored in a separate top-level collection (`weather_cache`) to allow for public `list` operations without exposing private user data.
