The primary change is storing `favoriteCities` as an array of objects directly within the `User` document in the `/users/{userId}` collection. This simplifies the data model by eliminating the need for a subcollection. This design is efficient for reads, as a single document read fetches all of a user's profile and favorite cities. It's well-suited for scenarios where the number of favorites per user is not excessively large. The rest of the structure remains the same, with `weather_cache` for public data caching."
